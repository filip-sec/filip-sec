### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Filipn from Slovakia, and I do do everything related to IT and electronics. I really enjoy learning languages and new technologies like Java and Python, as well as work with neural networks . I also enjoy creating automated systems such as hydropnics, where i can explore the intersection of biology and electronics.
